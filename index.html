            <h2>Methok's story</h2> 
            <p> In a small, remote village in Tibet lived Methok, a girl with a passion for coding. This passion was sparked by her father, who had attended college for computer science but chose to abandon his studies to raise his family in the village. Unfortunately, the village‚Äôs limited resources meant her school taught only basic subjects, with no access to computer science courses.

            <h2>‚õ∞Ô∏è Dharamsala</h2> 
            <p> After fleeing into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lama established the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India. Though outside Tibet‚Äôs borders, Dharamsala has become a third symbolic capital ‚Äî a refuge where culture, language, and faith continue to flourish against all odds. </p> <p> From this hillside town, generations of Tibetans in exile have preserved their identity, taught their history, and sustained a vision of return. Dharamsala stands as a global reminder that while Tibet‚Äôs land may be occupied, its spirit remains unbroken. </p>

        <p> From the sacred heights of Yumbhulhagang in the Yarlung Valley to the grandeur of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet‚Äôs historical journey reflects a profound evolution ‚Äî from mythic beginnings to a unified kingdom grounded in spiritual leadership and cultural identity. The 7th-century move to Lhasa under King Songtsen Gampo marked a turning point in Tibet‚Äôs political and religious life, with the Potala becoming a lasting symbol of that union. Today, as the map traces these historic paths, it also points beyond ‚Äî to Dharamsala in exile, where the spirit of Tibet continues to thrive through memory, resistance, and renewal. </p>
