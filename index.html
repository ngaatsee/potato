            <h2>Methok's story</h2> 
            <p> In a small, remote village in Tibet lived Methok, a girl with a passion for coding. This passion was sparked by her father, who had attended college for computer science but chose to abandon his studies to raise his family in the village. Unfortunately, the village’s limited resources meant her school taught only basic subjects, with no access to computer science courses.

            <h2>The Man who Changed her Life</h2> 
            <p> On her way to school, she noticed a man sitting quietly on the side of the road, clearly hungry. Even though she didn’t have much, she offered him half of her lunch. Moved by her kindness, the man smiled and revealed his identity, it was Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft. He had come to the village to quietly seek out students with talent and compassion. After meeting her, he knew he had found someone special. He decided to sponsor her and help her follow her dreams in computer science.

            <h2>How it Ended</h2> 
            <p> After meeting Bill Gates, Methok’s life took a remarkable turn. She was finally able to pursue her dream of studying computer science. She went to a top university and once she graduated, she dedicated her skills to improving her village and supporting the people of Tibet.

        <h2></h2>
        <p> From the sacred heights of Yumbhulhagang in the Yarlung Valley to the grandeur of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet’s historical journey reflects a profound evolution — from mythic beginnings to a unified kingdom grounded in spiritual leadership and cultural identity. The 7th-century move to Lhasa under King Songtsen Gampo marked a turning point in Tibet’s political and religious life, with the Potala becoming a lasting symbol of that union. Today, as the map traces these historic paths, it also points beyond — to Dharamsala in exile, where the spirit of Tibet continues to thrive through memory, resistance, and renewal. </p>
