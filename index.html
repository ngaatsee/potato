            <h2>Methok's story</h2> 
            <p> In a small, remote village in Tibet lived Methok, a girl with a passion for coding. This passion was sparked by her father, who had attended college for computer science but chose to abandon his studies to raise his family in the village. Unfortunately, the village’s limited resources meant her school taught only basic subjects, with no access to computer science courses.

            <h2>The Man who Changed her Life</h2> 
            <p> On her way to school, she noticed a man sitting quietly on the side of the road, clearly hungry. Even though she didn’t have much, she offered him half of her lunch. Moved by her kindness, the man smiled and revealed his identity, it was Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft. He had come to the village to quietly seek out students with talent and compassion. After meeting her, he knew he had found someone special. He decided to sponsor her and help her follow her dreams in computer science.
